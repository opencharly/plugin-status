// overlay.go — the PURE nested-deployment overlay for `charly status`, ported verbatim (same
// semantics, new data shape) from the former charly/status_nested.go applyNestedOverlay /
// buildNestedChildren / nestedChildStatus / claimFlatRow. It operates ENTIRELY on the wire-safe
// []spec.StatusNestedNode tree the host pre-resolves (buildStatusRootsTree,
// charly/status_nested.go) — NO core types, NO ResolveDeployChain, NO classifyTarget: every
// kind/match-key/live-status decision was already made host-side.
//
// Preserved EXACTLY:
//   - claim → inherit the flat row's real data + provenance → drop the claimed row from the top
//     level (dedup), so a declared nested child that ALSO surfaced as its own flat top-level row
//     (a nested-pod's flattened charly-<seg1_seg2> container, or an android-substrate row at its
//     dotted path) appears exactly once, under its parent.
//   - synthesize a "declared"/Source="nested" row when no flat match exists.
//   - a declared parent with NO flat row attaches nothing (no phantom parent row).
//   - children emit in the HOST's sorted key order (buildStatusChildNodes already sorted them;
//     this file never re-sorts).
//   - under --nested, EVERY child's Status is overwritten by its live-probe verdict
//     ("reachable"/"unreachable"), even a claimed (already-real) child — mirrors the former
//     nestedChildStatus's unconditional `cs.Status = probeNestedChildLive(...)` under
//     opts.Nested. The host only populates LiveStatus when nested was requested
//     (probeNestedChildLive always returns a non-empty verdict), so `LiveStatus != ""` is the
//     exact candy-side equivalent of the former `opts.Nested` check.
//   - RunMode: the former code stamped every synthesized/claimed nested row with the single
//     opts.RunMode value (uniform across one `charly status` invocation, never overwritten by a
//     claim). Since every flat row in one reply carries that SAME opts.RunMode (every substrate
//     collector stamps it), this file derives the equivalent value from the ROOT's own flat row
//     (rows[pi].RunMode) and threads it through the whole recursion — byte-identical output with
//     no extra wire field.

// applyNestedOverlay folds the host-pre-resolved nested tree into the parent rows for the
// `charly status` table/JSON/detail output, deduplicating claimed flat rows out of the top level.
